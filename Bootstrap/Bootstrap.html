          <p>Robocraft is an online third-person vehicle combat game set in areas of different planets.
            It is fully released, and is developed and published by the indie video game
            developer Freejam Games based in the United Kingdom.
            Players construct robots to fight with and against others in battle,
            which is a semi-unique feature of this game.[1] The game features contained garages
            in which players can build various functional vehicles with basic block-based parts
            (such as cubes and wheels) along with weapons that can be used for combat.
            The initial alpha build was released in March 2013, featuring a single-player building
            and test mode. In April 2013, Freejam Games released multiplayer combat, which is now the core
            content of the game. Content updates and bug fixes for the game are released a few times
            each month. On April 14, 2014, the company revealed that Robocraft had gained over
            300,000 players in a few months; the game continues to attract many players, notably,
            international players from non-English speaking countries.[2][3] It is also available
            as a Steam platform release with 43 achievements.[4]
            According to SteamSpy: Robocraft, as of December 2017, has over 13.5 million sales

          <p>
            Robocraft is a "build, drive, fight"[6]
            game where players build their robots from building parts that can be bought for "Robits",
            the in game currency. Robits can be earned by fighting battles, where you earn more by
            destroying more enemys and capturing more mining points, or by selling building parts.
            Players have the option to play multiple game modes that offer different experiences,
            for example Player Vs AI, Brawl and custom games.
          </p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
          <p class="lead display-4" style="text-align: center;">Currency</p>
          <p>
            Robocraft uses "Robits" as its currency. Robits are used to buy parts, which is called
            "Forging". They are earned by selling parts using the "Recycler" or playing matches.
            Before June 19th 2018, you could also get items from crates. After that date,
            they were removed and instead you get Robits only[7]. The more Experience you get in a match,
            the more Robits you earn. Currently, you can not have a level above 10,1000.

          <p>
            The tech tree was added on June 19th 2018[7] , this allows players to get the different
            parts that they want instead of them being randomly given parts via crates. Players are given
            the freedom to build and customize their robots in any way they like,[1] as long as it does
            not exceed their in-game CPU limit (2000). The player's CPU limit does not increase as they
            level up. Different chassis and hardware blocks consume different amounts of CPU.
            The game also has a weapon energy system, which defines how long you can shoot with
            your weapons. Different weapons consume different amounts of energy per shot.
            After a bot passes 2000 CPU it becomes a Megabot,
            which can only join Custom Games and Play vs AI gamemodes. Also as of June 19th
